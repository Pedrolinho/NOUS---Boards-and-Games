# NOUS - Boards and Games
This was a project developed for Bradesco's Back-End course with PUCPR.

The objective was to create a store with a free theme to explore and deepen our studies involving OOP. In my project I decided to create an application for a card and board game store.

The project was developed exclusively in Java, using the Swing framework.

Project created in 2022.
