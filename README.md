# NOUS - Boards and Games
This was a project developed for Bradesco's Back-End course with PUCPR.

The objective was to create a store with a free theme to explore and deepen our studies involving OOP. In my project I decided to create an application for a card and board game store.

The project was developed exclusively in Java, using the Swing framework. The main functional systems present in it are simple user registration and product search.

Project created in 2022.
